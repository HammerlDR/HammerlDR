### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**HammerlDR/HammerlDR** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my doctoral thesis in Biochem
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about anything chemistry related an I will tell you what I do not know
- âš¡ Fun fact: nothing to see here, move along
